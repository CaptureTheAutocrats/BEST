# BEST: Business-driven, Efficient, Secure, Trustworthy E-Commerce Solution for Students

## Overview

**BEST** is a university-centric e-commerce platform designed specifically for students at the Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT). The platform leverages microcontroller-based secure lock systems and aromatic boxes to facilitate fast, low-cost, and secure peer-to-peer transactions. Sellers deposit items in designated boxes, and buyers retrieve them directly, eliminating traditional delivery bottlenecks.

## Motivation

Students at BUBT face significant financial challenges, including rising tuition fees, limited part-time job opportunities, and the need to purchase expensive study materials. Traditional e-commerce platforms exacerbate these issues through high commission rates, slow delivery, and costly logistics. BEST addresses these pain points by:

- **Reducing Financial Barriers:** Low commissions (2–3%), no delivery fees, and instant liquidity for sellers.
- **Empowering Student Entrepreneurship:** Enabling students to monetize unused items or start small businesses with minimal upfront costs.
- **Fostering Sustainable Consumption:** Promoting the resale of second-hand items to reduce e-waste.

## Project Advantages Over Traditional E-Commerce
